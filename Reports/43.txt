The victim was working alone with the TUX Slitter No. 8, and was moving to the "cross cut" to remove the product on the F side, when he noticed something stuck to the cross cut bar and reached out with his right hand to remove it. He got his right wrist caught between the cross cutter bar and the touch roller arm.
