At Slitter no. 12, two workers were extending a whole cloth that was curling at the edges. Worker A operated the slitter and Worker B was pulling the curled edges. He started off pulling the west edge, but then the east edge started to curl, so he was moving to the east edge when his right hand came in contact with the rotating roll and his right hand got caught in it and pulled in.

Gap between rolls: 40mm
